### Research
  * [Research and Recommendation Project](https://github.com/K-Bloch/research-and-recommendation-project)
    * Conducted research to identify three dishwasher models that met specific client requirements. Compared each model based on functionality, price, and features to determine the best option. Analyzed the technical specifications of an older model to ensure compatibility with newer options.

### More
  * [Text Summarization Web App with Hugging Face Integration](https://replit.com/@karolinabloch/AI-Text-Summarizer-App-final)
    * Tech Stack: Node.js, Express, Axios, HTML, CSS, REST API, LLM, Hugging Face

    * The app connects to two Hugging Face models:
      * `bart-large-cnn` for text summarization (pre-trained on English and fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail).
      * `Stable Diffusion v1-4` for text-to-image generation.
    * The guided portion covered the text summarizer implementation, while I developed:
